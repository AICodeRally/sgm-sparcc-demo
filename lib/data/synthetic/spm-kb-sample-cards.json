      "definition": "A higher commission rate applied after exceeding a performance threshold, typically quota attainment, rewarding overperformance.",
      "whyItMatters": "Accelerators drive 15-30% of overperformance in well-designed plans. Without them, top reps have no incentive to exceed quota once they've hit target. They're the primary tool for motivating stretch performance and retaining top talent.",
      "extendedDefinition": "Accelerators increase the commission rate once a rep surpasses a defined threshold, usually 100% quota attainment. The increased rate applies only to sales above the threshold, not retroactively to all sales. They can be structured as single-tier (one rate above quota) or multi-tier (progressive rates at higher attainment levels).",
      "howItWorks": "Base rate applies up to threshold (usually 100% quota). Above threshold, accelerated rate kicks in (typically 1.25x-2x base rate). Can be tiered (110%=1.25x, 125%=1.5x) or continuous. Rate multiplier resets each measurement period. Calculated as: Overage Amount × Accelerated Rate.",
      "example": "Rep at $100K quota with 10% base commission rate. At 110% attainment ($110K revenue), accelerator of 1.5x applies to the $10K overage: $10K × 15% = $1,500 commission on overage, vs $1,000 at base rate. Total earnings: $10K (base) + $1,500 (accelerated) = $11,500.",
