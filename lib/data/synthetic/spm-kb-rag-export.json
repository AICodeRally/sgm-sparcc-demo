      "content": "# Accelerator\n\n**Definition:** A higher commission rate applied after exceeding a performance threshold, typically quota attainment, rewarding overperformance.\n**Also known as:** kicker, uplift, multiplier, upside rate\n\n**Why It Matters:** Accelerators drive 15-30% of overperformance in well-designed plans. Without them, top reps have no incentive to exceed quota once they've hit target. They're the primary tool for motivating stretch performance and retaining top talent.\n\nAccelerators increase the commission rate once a rep surpasses a defined threshold, usually 100% quota attainment. The increased rate applies only to sales above the threshold, not retroactively to all sales. They can be structured as single-tier (one rate above quota) or multi-tier (progressive rates at higher attainment levels).",

      "content": "# Accelerator - Guidance\n\n**How It Works:** Base rate applies up to threshold (usually 100% quota). Above threshold, accelerated rate kicks in (typically 1.25x-2x base rate). Can be tiered (110%=1.25x, 125%=1.5x) or continuous. Rate multiplier resets each measurement period. Calculated as: Overage Amount × Accelerated Rate.\n\n**Example:** Rep at $100K quota with 10% base commission rate. At 110% attainment ($110K revenue), accelerator of 1.5x applies to the $10K overage: $10K × 15% = $1,500 commission on overage, vs $1,000 at base rate. Total earnings: $10K (base) + $1,500 (accelerated) = $11,500.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Set first accelerator at 100% attainment (not higher) to reward all overperformance\n- Make the rate jump meaningful (minimum 1.25x) to drive behavior change\n- Pair with decelerator below threshold to fund the upside\n- Cap at 3x base rate maximum to prevent windfall payouts\n- Limit to 3 tiers maximum to maintain simplicity\n- Communicate clearly in plan document with examples\n\n**Watch Out For:**\n- Cliff accelerators that create sandbagging behavior (reps holding deals)\n- Too many tiers causing confusion and reduced motivation\n- Accelerators without caps leading to budget overruns\n- Misalignment with quota-setting (easy quotas + high accelerators = windfall)\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n- Setting first accelerator above 100% (e.g., 110%) leaving a 'dead zone'\n- Using same accelerator rates across all roles regardless of leverage\n- Forgetting to model accelerator cost in plan budgeting",

Late or incorrect payments create legal exposure, damage morale, and increase rep attrition.

For terminated employees: demand direct repayment or pursue legal remedies. Track all recoveries to completion.\n\n**Example:** Rep earned $5,000 on 12-month contract. Customer cancels at month 3. Pro-rata recovery: $5,000 × (9/12) = $3,750 deducted from next commission payment. If insufficient, spread across subsequent payments.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Pro-rate recovery based on time elapsed when reasonable\n- Cap recovery at original amount paid\n- Provide advance notice before deduction\n- Set maximum offset percentage per pay period (e.g., 50%)\n- Include recovery rights in employment/contractor agreements\n\n**Watch Out For:**\n- State wage law restrictions on commission deductions\n- Terminated employee recovery challenges\n- Collection costs exceeding recovery amount\n- Negative morale impact of aggressive recovery",

Calculate residual risk. Prioritize high-risk areas for testing and monitoring. Update annually or when significant changes occur.\n\n**Example:** Risk matrix: Manual adjustments (High inherent, Medium controls = High residual). Automated calculations (Medium inherent, Strong controls = Low residual). Focus audit on manual adjustments.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Involve process owners in risk identification\n- Consider fraud risk scenarios\n- Update assessment for system or process changes\n- Align with enterprise risk management framework\n- Document risk rationale for audit trail\n\n**Watch Out For:**\n- Outdated risk assessments missing new exposures\n- Overconfidence in control effectiveness\n- Missing fraud risk considerations\n- Risk-blind spots in emerging areas",

Compare results at multiple levels (total, by plan, by rep). Investigate variances above threshold. Document explanations for expected differences. Remediate unexpected discrepancies.\n\n**Example:** Parallel reconciliation: Calculate January in both Excel and new ICM → Compare totals (within 0.5% threshold) → Drill into variances → Document rounding difference explanation → Sign off for production use.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Define acceptable variance thresholds\n- Reconcile at multiple levels of detail\n- Document all variance explanations\n- Involve finance in sign-off\n- Retain reconciliation for audit\n\n**Watch Out For:**\n- Rounding differences appearing as errors\n- Timing differences in transaction recognition\n- Configuration differences from prior system\n- Incomplete data in one system",

Reference points are set by communication and prior experience.\n\n**Example:** Rep earning $200K after earning $180K last year feels successful. Same rep earning $200K after being told target was $220K feels like failure. Identical outcome, different reference point.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Set quota and OTE as clear reference points\n- Communicate plan changes relative to opportunity\n- Be intentional about peer visibility\n- Help reps see progress over baseline\n- Consider how past performance anchors expectations\n\n**Watch Out For:**\n- Windfall year creates problematic anchor\n- Peer comparisons can demotivate\n- Territory changes shift reference points\n- Unrealistic anchors lead to dissatisfaction",

      "content": "# Change Readiness Assessment - Guidance\n\n**How It Works:** Assess dimensions: awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, reinforcement. Survey stakeholders on readiness factors. Score and map results. Identify high-risk groups and resistance patterns. Design targeted interventions.\n\n**Example:** Readiness survey shows: Field reps 65% ready (concern about system complexity), Managers 80% ready (eager for team visibility), Finance 90% ready (want automated accruals). Intervention: Extra field training focus.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Assess all impacted stakeholder groups\n- Use validated readiness frameworks (ADKAR)\n- Repeat assessment at key milestones\n- Connect readiness to training and communication\n- Track improvement over time\n\n**Watch Out For:**\n- Social desirability bias in surveys\n- Missing silent resistors\n- Readiness can decline without reinforcement\n- Assessment without action is waste",

Each owner ensures quality and approves access.
