      "whyItMatters": "SoD is foundational to SOX compliance. Without proper segregation, a single actor could manipulate compensation data, approve their own payments, and hide discrepancies. 58% of organizations reported increased SOX compliance burden in 2024, making automated SoD controls essential.",
      "extendedDefinition": "In sales compensation, SoD typically separates: data entry from approval, calculation from payment, and system administration from business operations. The principle ensures independent verification at each step of the compensation process.",
      "howItWorks": "Define incompatible duties (e.g., quota setter cannot be payment approver). Map roles to permissions in the SPM system. Implement system controls preventing conflicting access. Monitor for violations through automated scanning. Review and remediate role creep periodically.",
